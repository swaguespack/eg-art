## USER STORY 

As a supporter of local artists, I want an application that will give users easy access to local artists work and ways to get in touch with them. I want to be able to navigate between contact, gallery, and about pages to get a good idea of who the featured artist is. When I sign up or into Artfolio, I want the ability to save artwork from the gallery and leave comments on pieces for the artist.


## TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED

*Node.js
*Express
